# Modeling-the-Stirling-Cycle
This project has the goal to model the Stirling cycle from a realistic Stirling Engine given from Statistical and Thermal Physics Using Matlab by Anders Malthe-Sorenssen and Dag Kristian Dysthe, University of Oslo, Norway. We will be taking into account that the angle of the flywheel attached to the piston will be changing with time with respect to a differential equation given in the paper. After solving the differential, we will calculate how pressure changes with volume in a PV graph to display our results.
